= schmobile

A mobile user agent detection Rack middleware.

== Redirecting

It can be configured to return the user to an explicit destination:

  use Rack::Schmobile, :redirect_to => "/mobile"

It supports string interpolation for dynamic destinations:

  use Rack::Schmobile, :redirect_to => "/mobile/#!/{{path}}"

== Forcing mobile mode

You can force toggle mobile mode by sending +schmobile_mode=enabled+ and +schmobile_mode=disabled+ - note that these
require session access.

Finally the middleware provides Rack::Request#is_mobile?

== User agent detection

You can add/remove user agents like so:

Rack::Schmobile.add_user_agent_pattern("wibble")
Rack::Schmobile.remote_user_agent_pattern("ipad")

== Contributing to schmobile

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
